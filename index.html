           Have you ever met someone you think about
every night and every day,
someone so beautiful it's breathtaking
and words just aren't enough to say?

Have you ever met someone so special
you can't imagine life without,
someone you want to talk forever
and learn everything about?

Have you ever met someone just as crazy
who wanted to have just as much fun,
someone you can dance all night with
and together watch the rising sun?

Have you ever met someone so amazing
you wish you could pause the time so it doesn't end?
This someone is you,
and I'd like you to be my girlfriend.
